          trust as a virtue has consistently played an essential role in every great human
          achievement. and consistently, its importance has been overlooked. not just by
          individuals, but by entire societies. we felt it was time someone gave it the spotlight it
          deserves. especially for the ones who live by this virtue: the trustworthy.

          so we thought of creating a system that rewards its members for doing good and being
          trustworthy. this way, trust as a virtue becomes something to aspire to, just the way it
          should be. then we went one step ahead: we built it. we know we are on the right track
          because here you are.
